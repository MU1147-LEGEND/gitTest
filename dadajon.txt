My dream about vultures has come true, 1

My bird of happiness left me and flew.  2

I stay grieving all alone and orphan.  3

My father is departing on mortal caravan,  4

Our date will be on the day of Judgement.  5

Daddy, who will scold me, if I am wrong?  6

Daddy, who will stand on wedding parties?  7

Daddy, how can I be without your prayers?  8

Daddy, who will wait me, if I come home?  9

------------------------

When I decided to serve you,  10

And built a terrace paying homage,  11

My darling had rode a horse without saddle.  12

My King is leaving in a mortal caravan.  13

Our date will be on the day of Judgment.  14

Daddy, who will scold me, if I am wrong?  15

Daddy, who will stand on wedding parties?  16

Daddy, how can I be without your prayers?  17
  
Daddy, who will wait me, if I come home?  18

Garden will turn into desert without Gardner.  19

---------------------------

Nation will become bondmen without Master.  20

Home will turn into dark grave without Father.  21

My only one is leaving in mortal caravan,  22

Our date will be on the day of Judgment. 23

Daddy, who will scold me, if I am wrong?  24

Daddy, who will stand on wedding parties?  25

Daddy, how can I be without your prayers?  26

Daddy, who will wait me, if I come home?  27
